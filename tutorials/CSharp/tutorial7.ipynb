    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 6, we saw how the optimizers took an argument called the 'learning rate,' but didn't spend much time on it except to say that it could have a great impact on how quickly training would converge toward a solution. In fact, you can choose the learning rate (LR) so poorly, that the training doesn't converge at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the LR is too small, training will go very slowly, wasting compute resources. If it is too large, training could result in numeric overflow, or NaNs. Either way, you're in trouble."

    "To further complicate matters, it turns out that the learning rate shouldn't necessarily be constant. Training can go much better if the learning rate starts out relatively large and gets smaller as you get closer to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a solution for this, called a Learning Rate Scheduler. An LRS instance has access to the internal state of the optimizer, and can modify the LR as it goes along. \n",

For this trivial model, using a scheduler isn't going to make a huge difference, and it may not make much of a difference even for complex models. It's very hard to know until you try it, but now you know how to try it out. If you try this trivial example over and over, you will see that the results vary quite a bit. It's simply too simple.\n",
